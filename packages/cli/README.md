ALGOLIA_WRITE_KEY=your_algolia_write_key
HEADLESS_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
HEADLESS_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=your_password
GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:3000/api/graphql
```

### Description

### Command Environment Variables (Cloud Run Job)

You can pass `feed-algolia` options via environment variables, which is useful for Cloud Run Jobs.
Defaults are applied only when the env var is not set; CLI flags may override.
CLI flags are additive for data-type selection (topics/legislators/speeches). If you enable a data type via env, adding another flag includes both.
For meeting/session terms and dryrun, CLI flags override environment variables when both are provided.

| Variable                | Description                                              | Default (env unset, before CLI flags) |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `LAWMAKER_MEETING_TERM` | Same as `--meeting-term`                                 | `11`                                  |
| `LAWMAKER_SESSION_TERM` | Same as `--session-term`                                 | `all`                                 |
| `LAWMAKER_TOPICS`       | Same as `--topics` (boolean)                             | `false`                               |
| `LAWMAKER_LEGISLATORS`  | Same as `--legislators` (boolean)                        | `false`                               |
| `LAWMAKER_SPEECHES`     | Same as `--speeches` (boolean)                           | `false`                               |
| `LAWMAKER_DRYRUN`       | Same as `--dryrun` / `--no-dryrun` (boolean)             | `true`                                |

Boolean values accept: `true/false` (case-sensitive).

## Command: `feed-algolia`

Feed Algolia search indices with updated records.

### Options

If no data-type flags are provided, the command runs all data types (topics, legislators, and speeches).

* `--meeting-term` (required)
  Legislative meeting term. Required for all runs.

* `--session-term`
  Legislative meeting session term. Only for updating speeches. Accepts numeric value or `all` to process every session in the specified meeting term.

* `--topics`
  Only update topic records.

* `--legislators`
  Only update legislator records.

* `--speeches`
  Only update speech records.

* `--dryrun`
  Do not upload to Algolia (default behavior).

* `--no-dryrun`
  Actually upload data to Algolia.

### Examples

```bash
# Default (no data-type flags): dry run all data types in meeting term 11
yarn lawmaker feed-algolia --meeting-term 11

# Use environment defaults (Cloud Run Job style)
LAWMAKER_MEETING_TERM=11 LAWMAKER_SPEECHES=true LAWMAKER_DRYRUN=false yarn lawmaker feed-algolia

# Dry run only topics in the meeting-term 10
yarn lawmaker feed-algolia --meeting-term 10 --topics

# Actually upload speeches in the meeting-term 11 and session-term 2
yarn lawmaker feed-algolia --meeting-term 11 --session-term 2 --speeches --no-dryrun
```
